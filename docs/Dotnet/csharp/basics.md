# Programming Overview

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks. These instructions, often written in a programming language like **C#**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, or **Java**, are known as **statements** or **commands**, and they direct the computer on _what_ to do and _how_ to do it.

## Purpose of Instructions

Each instruction typically serves a distinct purpose, such as:

- **Input Handling** – accepting data from users, files, or other systems.
- **Data Processing** – performing calculations, manipulating strings, or transforming datasets.
- **Decision Making** – using conditional logic (`if`, `switch`, etc.) to determine which path of execution to follow.
- **Looping** – repeating a set of operations using loops (`for`, `while`, etc.).
- **Output** – displaying results, writing to files, or sending data to external systems.
- **Error Handling** – detecting and managing errors gracefully using constructs like `try-catch`.

## Execution Flow

Together, these instructions form the **logic** of an application. When compiled or interpreted, they become executable commands that the computer understands and performs sequentially or conditionally based on the logic flow.
