# Basics of C#

## 1. What is Computer programming?

**Answer:**  
Computer Programming is also known as programming or coding. Programming is a process which includes processes such as coding, maintaining, updating, debugging, writing, designing (algorithm), etc.

## 2. What is Computer programming?

**Answer:**

# Programming Overview

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks. These instructions, often written in a programming language like **C#**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, or **Java**, are known as **statements** or **commands**, and they direct the computer on _what_ to do and _how_ to do it.

## Purpose of Instructions

Each instruction typically serves a distinct purpose, such as:

- **Input Handling** – accepting data from users, files, or other systems.
- **Data Processing** – performing calculations, manipulating strings, or transforming datasets.
- **Decision Making** – using conditional logic (`if`, `switch`, etc.) to determine which path of execution to follow.
- **Looping** – repeating a set of operations using loops (`for`, `while`, etc.).
- **Output** – displaying results, writing to files, or sending data to external systems.
- **Error Handling** – detecting and managing errors gracefully using constructs like `try-catch`.

## Execution Flow

Together, these instructions form the **logic** of an application. When compiled or interpreted, they become executable commands that the computer understands and performs sequentially or conditionally based on the logic flow.

## 3. What is debugging?

**Answer:**

**Debugging** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing bugs or errors in a software program.

## 🔍 What is a Bug?

A **bug** is any issue in a program that causes it to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly. Bugs can include:

- Syntax errors
- Logic errors
- Runtime exceptions
- Incorrect outputs

## What is Debugging?

> Debugging is the step-by-step process developers use to detect, isolate, and resolve issues in their code to ensure the software behaves as intended.

---

## Key Steps in Debugging

1. **Reproduce the Problem**  
   Run the application to observe the issue in action.

2. **Analyze the Error**  
   Use logs, console outputs, or error messages to understand where and why the issue occurs.

3. **Use Debugging Tools**  
   Common tools include:

   - Visual Studio Debugger
   - Chrome DevTools
   - Postman (for API testing)
   - Logging frameworks (e.g., Serilog, NLog)

4. **Isolate the Faulty Code**  
   Narrow down the specific section of code responsible for the issue.

5. **Fix the Bug**  
   Modify the code to correct the logic, syntax, or configuration causing the issue.

6. **Test Again**  
   Re-run the application to ensure the issue is resolved and no new bugs have been introduced.

## Why is Debugging Important?

- Ensures **code correctness** and **application reliability**
- Improves **user experience** by preventing unexpected behavior
- Helps developers **gain deeper understanding** of the codebase
- Reduces **technical debt** in the long run
