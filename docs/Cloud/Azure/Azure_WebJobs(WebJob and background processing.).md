**WebJob and background processing.**

### 1. Why WebJobs?

ü§î Why Use Azure WebJobs?

Azure WebJobs provide an easy way to run background tasks or scripts in the context of an Azure App Service (Web App). They simplify running scheduled or continuous jobs without managing separate infrastructure.

**Key Benefits of WebJobs**

- **Integrated with App Services:** Runs inside the same environment as your web app, sharing resources and scaling.
- **Simple to Deploy:** Deploy code or scripts alongside your web app without separate VM or service.

- **Multiple Execution Modes:**

        - Continuous: Runs continuously in the background.
        - Triggered: Runs on demand or scheduled (using Azure Scheduler or TimerTriggers).

- **Supports Various Languages:** Run .NET, PowerShell, Python, Node.js, and more.
- **Cost-Effective:** No need for separate VMs or services for background processing.
- **Easy Management:** Use Azure Portal or CLI to monitor, start, stop WebJobs.
- **Ideal for:**

         - Processing queues or blobs.
         - Scheduled maintenance tasks.
         - Data import/export.
         - Any background processing tasks related to your web app.

**When to Use WebJobs?**

- When you want to add background or scheduled jobs without extra infrastructure.
- When your background task is tightly coupled with your web app lifecycle.
- For lightweight to moderate background processing needs.

**Alternatives**

- For more complex or independent background processing, consider:

  - Azure Functions (serverless)
  - Azure Logic Apps
  - Azure Service Bus with worker roles or microservices

### 2. Types of Webjobs (Triggered, Continuos.)

üåÄ Types of Azure WebJobs

Azure WebJobs run background tasks in an Azure App Service environment and come in two main types:

**1. Continuous WebJobs**

- **Runs:** Continuously in the background as long as the App Service is running.
- **Use Cases:** Real-time processing, long-running tasks, listening to queues or events.

- **Behavior:**

        - Starts automatically when the App Service starts.
        - Runs in an infinite loop or waits for events/messages.

- **Example:** Monitoring a queue for incoming messages to process.

**2. Triggered WebJobs**

- **Runs:** On-demand or on a schedule.
- **Use Cases:** Periodic tasks, batch jobs, maintenance scripts.

- **Behavior:**

        - Manually triggered via Azure Portal, API, or CLI.
        - Scheduled using Azure Scheduler or TimerTrigger (if using WebJobs SDK).

- **Example:** Nightly database cleanup or report generation.

  **Summary Table**

| Type              | Execution Mode | Trigger              | Common Use Cases            |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Continuous WebJob | Always running | Starts automatically | Real-time queue processing  |
| Triggered WebJob  | Runs on demand | Manual or scheduled  | Scheduled maintenance tasks |

** Notes**

- Both types support various programming languages and scripts (.exe, .cmd, PowerShell, Python, etc.).
- Continuous jobs consume resources continuously, so use carefully to avoid excess cost.

### 3. View logs of WebJobs.

- Make sure to test CRON expressions with online tools like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/).

### 5. Always on importance in continous webjob

üîÑ Importance of "Always On" in Continuous WebJobs

**What is "Always On"?**

- **"Always On"** is an App Service setting that keeps your web app (and its associated WebJobs) running continuously, even when there is no HTTP traffic.
- By default, Azure may **idle** or **sleep** your app after a period of inactivity to save resources.

**Why is "Always On" Important for Continuous WebJobs?**

- **Continuous WebJobs require the app to be always running** to ensure the background job executes without interruption.

- If "Always On" is **disabled**:

        - The App Service may go idle after inactivity.
        - Continuous WebJobs will **stop running** until the app is accessed again.
        - This leads to missed processing, delays, or failure in real-time tasks.

  **Key Points**

| Aspect                            | Explanation                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keeps App Active                  | Prevents app from unloading due to inactivity               |
| Ensures WebJob Runs               | Continuous WebJobs keep running as expected                 |
| Required for Real-time Processing | Necessary for tasks like queue monitoring, event processing |
| Only Applies to App Service Plans | Not available for Free or Shared tiers                      |

**How to Enable "Always On"**

1. Go to your App Service in the Azure Portal.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Configuration**.
3. Select the **General settings** tab.
4. Set **Always On** to **On**.
5. Save the changes.

**Summary**

- For reliable execution of **Continuous WebJobs**, always enable **Always On**.
- Without it, your continuous background tasks may be paused, causing unexpected downtime.

### 6. Storage accounts in Webjobs

üíæ Storage Accounts in Azure WebJobs

**Overview**

- Azure WebJobs often rely on **Azure Storage Accounts** to enable messaging, state management, and logging.
- Storage accounts provide:

  - **Queues:** For triggering and coordinating WebJobs.
  - **Blobs:** For storing input/output data.
  - **Tables:** For storing metadata or state information.

**Role of Storage Accounts in WebJobs**

| Feature                  | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Queue Storage**        | WebJobs SDK can listen to Azure Queues to trigger job execution (e.g., process messages). |
| **Blob Storage**         | Input/output bindings for file processing or status data.                                 |
| **Table Storage**        | Store execution logs, checkpoints, or metadata for WebJobs.                               |
| **Logging & Monitoring** | WebJobs SDK uses storage accounts to persist logs and runtime status.                     |

**Why Use Storage Accounts with WebJobs?**

- **Triggering:** Many WebJobs run in response to queue messages or blob changes.
- **Scalability:** Storage queues decouple producers and consumers for load leveling.
- **Durability:** Durable storage ensures reliable processing and retry mechanisms.
- **Monitoring:** Tracks job executions and failures for diagnostics.

  **Configuration**

- WebJobs SDK requires a **connection string** to an Azure Storage Account.
- This is usually set in the `appsettings.json` or Azure Portal under **Application Settings** as `AzureWebJobsStorage`.
- Example connection string format:

**DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=youraccount;AccountKey=yourkey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net**

**Best Practices**

- Use a **separate storage account** for WebJobs to isolate workload and improve security.
- Enable **soft delete and lifecycle management** on storage to protect and manage data.
- Monitor storage account usage and scale accordingly.

**Summary**

| Aspect        | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Storage Types | Queues, Blobs, Tables                       |
| Purpose       | Triggering, state management, logging       |
| Configuration | Connection string via `AzureWebJobsStorage` |
| Best Practice | Use dedicated storage accounts for WebJobs  |
