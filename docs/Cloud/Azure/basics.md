# Azure step by step

### 1. Define SSAS, PAAS and IAAS ?

Cloud computing offers different levels of service models to fit various needs. The three primary models are:

| Feature      | SaaS                    | PaaS                             | IaaS                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Use Case     | End-user applications   | App development & deployment     | Full infrastructure control |
| Managed By   | Provider                | Shared (provider + developer)    | Mostly user                 |
| User Manages | Just usage (no backend) | Code & app config                | OS, middleware, app, data   |
| Examples     | Gmail, Zoom, Salesforce | Heroku, App Engine, Azure AppSvc | EC2, Azure VM, GCP Compute  |

---

> ‚úÖ **SaaS** is best for end users.  
> üë®‚Äçüíª **PaaS** is for developers.  
> üõ†Ô∏è **IaaS** is for sysadmins and architects.

### 2. How is cloud different from normal webhosting ?

| Feature            | Traditional Hosting         | Cloud Hosting              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Infrastructure** | Single physical server      | Cluster of virtual servers |
| **Scalability**    | Limited/manual              | Auto-scalable              |
| **Uptime**         | Low (server failure = down) | High (failover built-in)   |
| **Cost**           | Fixed pricing               | Pay-as-you-use             |
| **Performance**    | Affected by neighbors       | Load-balanced              |
| **Best For**       | Small/static sites          | Scalable, dynamic apps     |

### 3. Explain the 2 big O‚Äôs in cloud ?

| Concept                    | Description                                 | Real-World Analogy              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **On-Demand**              | Provision resources instantly when needed   | Like streaming movies (no DVDs) |
| **Operatinal Expenditure** | Pay for usage instead of upfront investment | Like paying utility bills       |

### 4. What is a resource and why do we need Resource groups ?

- Understanding Resources and Resource Groups in Cloud Computing

**What is a Resource?**

**Definition:**  
A **resource** is any manageable item available in your cloud environment. These are individual services that you create, manage, and pay for.

**Examples of Resources:**

- Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Storage Accounts
- SQL Databases
- Web Apps
- Virtual Networks (VNet)
- Kubernetes Clusters

Each resource represents a **single service** that performs a specific function.

**What is a Resource Group?**

**Definition:**  
A **Resource Group** is a **logical container** that holds related cloud resources. It helps organize and manage them as a unit.

**Why Do We Need Resource Groups?**

**1. Logical Organization**

Group resources by application, environment (dev/test/prod), or project. Makes it easier to locate and manage related items.

**2. Unified Management**

Apply permissions, tags, and policies at the group level. This ensures consistency across all resources inside it.

**3. Simplified Monitoring & Billing**

Monitor usage, set budgets, and track costs at the resource group level.

**4. Efficient Deployment**

Deploy, update, or delete all resources in a group together using templates (e.g., ARM or Bicep templates).

**5. Access Control**

Assign **role-based access** (RBAC) to an entire group, ensuring users can only interact with the resources they‚Äôre allowed to manage.

---

Example

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a web application called `MyApp`.

You could create a resource group named `MyApp-RG`, and include:

- `MyApp-VM` (Virtual Machine)
- `MyApp-SQL` (Database)

- `MyApp-Storage` (Blob Storage)
- `MyApp-WebApp` (App Service)

All of these resources will be grouped logically, and you can manage them together.

---

Summary

| Term               | Description                               | Example                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Resource**       | A cloud service instance                  | Azure VM, SQL DB, Blob Storage |
| **Resource Group** | A logical container for related resources | Group for `MyApp` services     |

**Think of a **Resource Group** as a folder, and **Resources** as the files inside it.**

### 5. What is the importance of Resource group location ?

When creating a **Resource Group** in Azure, you're asked to specify a **location (region)** ‚Äî but why does it matter?

What Is a Resource Group Location?

The **location** of a resource group refers to the **region where the metadata** for that group is stored.  
It does **not dictate** where all the resources inside must reside.

Why Is Resource Group Location Important?

**Metadata Storage**

The region determines where the **deployment data, management info, and tags** for the resource group are stored.

**Resource Deployment**

- Resources **can be deployed in any region**, regardless of the resource group's location.
- But some **services (like Azure Managed Identity, automation, or policy enforcement)** may rely on the resource group‚Äôs region.

**Compliance & Governance**

If your organization has **data residency** or **compliance requirements**, storing metadata in a specific region may be necessary.

**Availability & Disaster Recovery**

In case of a regional outage:

- The ability to **manage or update** resources might be affected if the **resource group‚Äôs location is down**, even if the actual resource is in a healthy region.

**Consistency in Deployment Templates**

Some ARM templates or scripts may use the resource group‚Äôs location as a default value for deploying resources.

---

Example Scenario

You create a resource group `MyApp-RG` in **East US**.

- You deploy a **VM** in **West US** and a **SQL DB** in **East US 2** ‚Äî both are valid.
- However, metadata like access policies or tags for `MyApp-RG` are stored in **East US**.
- If **East US** is down, you might not be able to update or delete the group until it's restored.

---

Best Practice

- Choose a **stable and compliant region** for the resource group location.
- If most of your resources are in a specific region, align the resource group with that region to reduce latency and simplify deployment.

---

Summary Table

| Aspect                  | Impact of Resource Group Location            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Metadata Storage**    | Determines where group metadata is stored    |
| **Resource Deployment** | Resources can live in any region             |
| **Outage Impact**       | Managing group may fail if location is down  |
| **Compliance**          | Important for legal/data governance          |
| **Template Defaults**   | Used in scripts to default resource location |

---

> **Note:** Resource group location ‚â† resource location ‚Äî but it still plays a key role in stability and governance.

### 6. What are app services ?

**Azure App Service** is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft Azure that allows developers to build, deploy, and scale web applications and APIs quickly and efficiently.

It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, including:

- ASP.NET / .NET Core

### 15. What is the problem of mapping work load with Azure configuration ?

Problem of Mapping Workload with Azure Configuration

Mapping workloads correctly with Azure configurations is critical to ensure optimal performance, cost-efficiency, and reliability. However, there are several challenges and problems that organizations face during this process:
‚ö†Ô∏è Common Problems

1.  **Incorrect Sizing of Resources**

- **Issue**: Choosing VM sizes or App Service plans that are too small or too large.
- **Impact**: Under-provisioning leads to performance bottlenecks; over-provisioning causes unnecessary costs.

2.  **Lack of Understanding of Workload Characteristics**

- **Issue**: Not analyzing CPU, memory, I/O, and scaling behavior of the workload.
- **Impact**: Results in misaligned service selection, such as using an App Service when a Function App would be more cost-effective.

3. **Improper Use of Service Tiers**

- **Issue**: Selecting wrong pricing tiers (e.g., Basic instead of Premium).
- **Impact**: Missing out on features like auto-scaling, staging slots, or high availability.

4.  **Ignoring Network and Storage Needs**

- **Issue**: Workload requires specific networking or storage configurations not accounted for.
- **Impact**: Leads to network bottlenecks or data latency issues.

5.  **Overlooking Compliance and Security Requirements**

- **Issue**: Not mapping workloads to services that meet regulatory or security needs.
- **Impact**: Non-compliance with industry standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
  üõ† Best Practices for Mapping

- **Use Azure Advisor**: Get real-time suggestions for performance and cost optimizations.
- **Perform Workload Assessment**: Analyze workload behavior using tools like Azure Migrate.
- **Right-size Continuously**: Use autoscaling and cost monitoring tools to adjust as usage changes.
- **Align with Business SLAs**: Choose configurations that support your uptime, latency, and DR requirements.
- **Leverage Azure Well-Architected Framework**: Follow guidelines to optimize reliability, performance, and cost.

‚úÖ Conclusion

Mapping workloads with the correct Azure configurations is not a one-time task. It requires continuous assessment and alignment with workload behavior, business goals, and cost considerations. Failure to do so can lead to degraded performance, security issues, and increased cloud bills.

### 16. Explain DTU and EDTU ?

Understanding DTU and eDTU in Azure SQL Database

When using Azure SQL Database, it's important to understand how Microsoft defines and allocates performance using **DTUs** and **eDTUs**. These units simplify resource management but can be confusing without proper context.
üí° What is a DTU?

**DTU (Database Transaction Unit)** is a blended measure of:

- **CPU**
- **Memory**
- **Reads and Writes (I/O)**

It represents the overall performance level for a **single Azure SQL database** in the **DTU-based purchasing model**.

> üí¨ Think of it as a performance "package" that wraps CPU, memory, and storage IOPS into one simplified number.

üî¢ Example DTU Tiers:

| **Tier** | **DTUs** | **Max Storage** |
| -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Basic    | 5        | 2 GB            |
| Standard | 10‚Äì300   | 250 GB          |
| Premium  | 125‚Äì4000 | 1 TB            |

üìò What is an eDTU?

**eDTU (Elastic DTU)** is the equivalent of DTU but applied to **Elastic Pools**.

- Elastic Pools are collections of databases that **share resources**.
- **eDTUs** are the total pooled performance capacity available to all databases within the pool.

> üß† eDTU = Shared DTU capacity across all databases in a pool

üîÑ Key Difference:

- **DTU** = For **single database**
- **eDTU** = For **elastic pool of databases**

üÜö DTU vs vCore Model

| Feature         | DTU Model                      | vCore Model                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Unit of measure | DTU (bundled)                  | vCore (CPU + memory separately)           |
| Flexibility     | Less granular                  | More control over resources               |
| Use case        | Simpler workloads, cost limits | Enterprise workloads, predictable scaling |
| Transparency    | Lower                          | Higher (you know exact CPU/memory)        |

‚úÖ When to Use

| Scenario                                                      | Choose                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| You want simple pricing and don't need fine-grained control   | **DTU model**              |
| You want transparency, control, and scalability               | **vCore model**            |
| You have multiple databases with unpredictable usage patterns | **eDTU with Elastic Pool** |

üìå Summary

- **DTU**: Performance metric for a **single database**, combining CPU, memory, and I/O.
- **eDTU**: Shared DTU performance metric for **elastic pools** (multiple databases).
- Useful for simplified performance planning, but less flexible than vCore-based pricing.

### 17. On which factors does DTU depend ?

üîç Factors on Which DTU Depends

A **DTU (Database Transaction Unit)** in Azure SQL Database is a pre-configured blend of three core resources:

1. **CPU (Compute Power)**

- Represents the **processing capability** of the database engine.
- DTU includes CPU cycles for:
  - Query execution
  - Indexing
  - Stored procedure processing
  - Complex joins or calculations

> ‚ö†Ô∏è CPU-bound queries can max out DTUs quickly.

2.  **Memory (RAM)**

- Used for:
  - **Query caching**
  - **Data buffering**
  - Sorting and hashing operations
  - Execution plans

> üí° Efficient use of memory can significantly reduce I/O and boost performance. 3. **Disk I/O (Reads and Writes)**

- Includes:
  - **Transaction log writes**
  - **Data page reads/writes**
  - TempDB usage
- I/O-heavy operations (bulk inserts, frequent reads) consume more DTUs.

> üìâ Poor indexing or large table scans increase I/O load and DTU usage.
> üîÅ DTU = Blended Metric

The DTU is essentially a **performance throttle** that balances:
DTU = f(CPU, Memory, Disk I/O)
If any one of the three resources hits its threshold, your **DTU usage approaches 100%**, throttling further performance.

üìä What Affects DTU Consumption?

| Factor                           | Impact on DTU         |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Complex or nested queries        | High CPU usage        |
| Missing indexes                  | Increased I/O         |
| Large result sets                | More memory and I/O   |
| High transaction volume          | CPU + I/O             |
| Long-running or blocking queries | CPU + Memory          |
| Poor query design                | All 3 (CPU, Mem, I/O) |

---

üõ† Tools to Monitor DTU Usage

- **Azure Portal ‚Üí SQL Database ‚Üí Monitoring ‚Üí DTU %**
- **Query Performance Insight**
- **Extended Events or Query Store**

---

‚úÖ Optimization Tips

- Use proper **indexing** and **query tuning**
- Reduce **I/O operations** by filtering and batching
- Enable **automatic tuning** in Azure SQL
- Consider scaling to a higher DTU or switch to **vCore** model for more control

---

üìå Summary

DTU depends on:

- **CPU usage**
- **Memory pressure**
- **Disk I/O operations**

Understanding workload behavior helps you choose the right DTU tier and optimize performance effectively.

### 18. How to calculate DTU ?

üìê How to Calculate DTU (Database Transaction Units)

Azure does not provide a direct formula to calculate DTUs because they are **abstract performance units**, blending CPU, memory, and I/O. However, Microsoft offers tools and guidance to help **estimate DTU requirements** based on your on-premise or existing workloads.

‚öôÔ∏è What is DTU?

> **DTU = A blended measure of CPU + Memory + IOPS**  
> It helps you choose the right Azure SQL Database performance level (Basic, Standard, Premium)

üßÆ How to Calculate or Estimate DTU Requirements

‚úÖ Option 1: Use Microsoft DTU Calculator (Recommended)

Microsoft provides a tool:  
üëâ [DTU Calculator](https://dtucalculator.azurewebsites.net/)

üìã Steps:

1. Run a workload on your existing SQL Server (on-premise or VM).
2. Collect performance metrics using **Performance Monitor (PerfMon)** for:
   - Processor: `% Processor Time`
   - Logical Disk: `Disk Reads/sec`, `Disk Writes/sec`
   - SQL Server: `Batch Requests/sec`
3. Export the data to a CSV.
4. Upload to the DTU Calculator.
5. The tool estimates the **minimum DTU tier** needed for Azure SQL Database.

üìä Example Metrics Collected

| Metric             | Description        |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| % Processor Time   | CPU utilization    |
| Disk Reads/sec     | Read I/O load      |
| Disk Writes/sec    | Write I/O load     |
| Batch Requests/sec | Workload intensity |

‚úÖ Option 2: Use Azure SQL Query Performance Insight

If you're already in Azure:

- Go to **SQL Database ‚Üí Monitoring ‚Üí Query Performance Insight**
- Check **DTU usage** over time
- Analyze **top-consuming queries**

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- DTUs are only relevant in the **DTU-based pricing model**.
- For **vCore-based models**, resource estimation is done separately (vCPU, RAM, IOPS).
- DTUs do **not map 1:1** with any physical resource; they are **relative units**.

üìå Summary

| Method                              | Use When                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| DTU Calculator                      | Migrating from on-prem or VM to Azure SQL |
| Azure Monitor & Insights            | Already in Azure environment              |
| Manual Estimation (not recommended) | Lacks precision without real metrics      |

> üß† DTU calculation is **estimative**, not exact. Always monitor after deployment to adjust tier if needed.

### 19. How to measure the five factors which derive DTU ?
