### 1. Differentiate between resource manager and classic ?

Azure provides two deployment models for resources: **Resource Manager (ARM)** and **Classic**. Below is a comparison of the two models:

1. Overview

| Feature               | Resource Manager (ARM)                                                    | Classic Deployment Model             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Introduced**        | 2014 (Modern model)                                                       | Pre-2014 (Legacy model)              |
| **Deployment Method** | Declarative templates (ARM templates)                                     | Manual or scripted (PowerShell, CLI) |
| **Resource Group**    | Resources are grouped logically using Resource Groups                     | No concept of Resource Groups        |
| **Management**        | Unified and consistent management via Azure Portal, PowerShell, CLI, SDKs | Limited and inconsistent management  |

2. Key Differences

| Aspect                 | Resource Manager (ARM)                             | Classic Deployment                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Grouping**           | Resources are deployed and managed as a group      | Resources are managed individually           |
| **RBAC Support**       | Supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)          | Limited RBAC (applies at subscription level) |
| **Tagging Support**    | Tags can be applied to resources and groups        | No tagging support                           |
| **Template Support**   | Supports Infrastructure-as-Code with ARM templates | No native template support                   |

### 7. Differentiate between LRS , ZRS , GRS and RA-GRS ?

Azure provides multiple **data redundancy options** to ensure high availability, durability, and disaster recovery of your data. These include:

- **LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)**
- **ZRS (Zone-Redundant Storage)**
- **GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage)**
- **RA-GRS (Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage)**

1. 🧠 Definitions

| Redundancy Option | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LRS**           | Replicates data 3 times within a single **datacenter** in one region.                        |
| **ZRS**           | Replicates data across **3 availability zones** in the **same region**.                      |
| **GRS**           | Replicates data to a **secondary region** hundreds of miles away (with LRS in both regions). |
| **RA-GRS**        | Same as GRS but allows **read-only access** to the secondary region.                         |

2. 📦 Use Case Comparison

| Scenario                                      | Recommended Redundancy |
