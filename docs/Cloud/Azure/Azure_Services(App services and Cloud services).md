- App Services offer easier and faster deployment with less management effort.

### 3. Impact on resource groups

üîÑ Impact on Resource Groups: Azure Cloud Services vs Azure App Services

Azure Resource Groups Overview

- A **Resource Group** is a logical container in Azure that holds related resources for an application or workload.
- It helps manage, deploy, and monitor resources as a single entity.

**Impact on Resource Groups**

| Aspect                | Azure Cloud Services                                                                                       | Azure App Services                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resource Group Scope  | Cloud Services (web roles, worker roles) and associated VMs, storage, networking grouped together          | App Service plan and all related apps grouped within the resource group     |
| Granularity           | Multiple related resources (VMs, roles) bundled, sometimes across resource groups if not carefully planned | Typically simpler, with App Service Plan + apps in one resource group       |
| Management Complexity | Higher ‚Äî more resources to manage within or across groups due to multiple roles and VMs                    | Lower ‚Äî fewer resource types, easier to organize and maintain               |
| Deployment Impact     | Updates may affect multiple related resources, requiring coordinated deployment                            | App Services deploy as single unit, simplified deployment in resource group |
| Monitoring & Billing  | Can be complex due to multiple associated resources                                                        | Easier aggregation of usage and costs per resource group                    |
| Resource Dependencies | Needs careful planning to avoid resource sprawl across groups                                              | Usually contained within fewer resources in a group                         |

**Summary**

- Both Cloud Services and App Services use resource groups as containers, but Cloud Services often involve **more complex resource structures**.
- App Services simplify resource group management by consolidating app components under fewer resources.
- Proper planning of resource groups is important for **cost management, access control, and deployment orchestration**.

### 4. Web role , Worker roles and Web jobs

**1. Web Role**

- Part of **Azure Cloud Services** (classic PaaS).
- Designed to host **web applications** and **web APIs**.
- Runs IIS (Internet Information Services) by default.
- Supports HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- Can be scaled by increasing the number of instances.
- Used for **front-end web workloads**.

**2. Worker Role**

- Also part of **Azure Cloud Services**.
- Designed to run **background processing** or **asynchronous tasks**.
- Does **not** run IIS and cannot serve HTTP requests directly.
- Runs custom code continuously or triggered by a schedule.
- Typically used for tasks like:
  - Queue processing
  - Batch jobs
  - Data processing
- Can be scaled independently of Web Roles.

**3. WebJobs**

- Feature of **Azure App Services** (modern PaaS).
- Runs background or scheduled jobs within an **App Service Plan**.
- Supports continuous, triggered (on-demand), or scheduled execution.
- Can run any executable or script (e.g., .exe, PowerShell, Python).
- Easy to deploy and manage alongside web apps.
- Ideal for lightweight background tasks without managing separate roles or VMs.

‚úÖ Summary Table

| Feature          | Web Role               | Worker Role            | WebJobs                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Platform         | Azure Cloud Services   | Azure Cloud Services   | Azure App Services           |
| Purpose          | Host web applications  | Background processing  | Background jobs/tasks        |
| Runs IIS?        | Yes                    | No                     | No                           |
| Deployment Model | Package-based (.cspkg) | Package-based (.cspkg) | Deployed within App Service  |
| Scalability      | Scalable instances     | Scalable instances     | Scales with App Service Plan |
| Use Cases        | Web front-end apps     | Queues, batch jobs     | Scheduled/continuous tasks   |

üìå Notes

- **Web Roles and Worker Roles** belong to the classic Azure Cloud Services model and are less commonly used for new projects.
- **WebJobs** provide a simpler, more flexible way to run background tasks within App Services.

### 5. Loosely coupled vs tightly couples deployment

**1. Tightly Coupled Deployment**

- **Definition:** Components or services are highly dependent on each other.

- **Characteristics:**

         - Changes in one component often require changes in others.
         - Deployment must be coordinated; often deployed together as a single unit.
         - Harder to scale or update parts independently.
         - Common in monolithic applications.

- **Pros:**

        - Simpler initial development.
        - Easier to test as a whole.

- **Cons:**

        - Difficult to maintain and evolve.
        - Higher risk of downtime during updates.
        - Poor scalability and flexibility.

**2. Loosely Coupled Deployment**

- **Definition:** Components or services operate independently with minimal dependencies.

- **Characteristics:**

        - Each service/component can be deployed, scaled, updated independently.
        - Communicate through well-defined APIs or messaging.
        - Supports microservices architecture.

- **Pros:**

        - Greater flexibility and scalability.
        - Easier maintenance and faster deployments.
        - Fault isolation ‚Äî one component failure less likely to impact others.

- **Cons:**

        - More complex to design and implement.
        - Requires robust inter-service communication mechanisms.

| Aspect          | Tightly Coupled                          | Loosely Coupled                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Dependency      | High dependency between components       | Minimal dependencies, independent      |
| Deployment      | Monolithic, coordinated deployment       | Independent deployments                |
| Scalability     | Limited, whole system scales             | Each component scales individually     |
| Flexibility     | Low, difficult to change parts           | High, easy to modify and evolve        |
| Fault Isolation | Poor ‚Äî one failure affects entire system | Good ‚Äî isolated failures               |
| Complexity      | Simpler initially                        | More complex design and infrastructure |

üìå Notes

        - Loosely coupled deployment is preferred for modern cloud-native and microservices applications.
        - Tightly coupled deployment might still be used for simple or legacy systems.

### 6. Configuration files in Azure deployment

**Overview**

Configuration files store settings and parameters that control application behavior and deployment environment without changing code. Azure supports multiple types of configuration files depending on the service and deployment model.

**Common Configuration Files in Azure**

| File Type                      | Purpose                                                            | Typical Usage                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **appsettings.json**           | Application-specific settings (e.g., connection strings, API keys) | ASP.NET Core and other modern apps                    |
| **web.config**                 | IIS and .NET Framework app configuration                           | Traditional ASP.NET apps on Azure App Service         |
| **ARM Templates**              | Infrastructure-as-Code for deploying Azure resources               | Declarative deployment of resources and configs       |
| **Bicep Files**                | Simplified ARM templates                                           | Infrastructure deployments with more readable syntax  |
| **.env files**                 | Environment variables for local development                        | Local development and containerized app configuration |
| **applicationHost.config**     | IIS server-level settings                                          | Azure App Service advanced IIS configuration          |
| **host.json**                  | Azure Functions runtime configuration                              | Configure triggers, logging, retry policies           |
| **local.settings.json**        | Local settings for Azure Functions development                     | Local development environment variables               |
| **service.json / config.json** | Custom app config files                                            | App-specific custom configurations                    |

**Deployment Configuration Approaches**

- **Slot Settings:** In Azure App Services, deployment slots can have slot-specific settings to avoid overriding production values.
- **Azure App Configuration:** Centralized service to manage app settings and feature flags dynamically.
- **Azure Key Vault:** Secure storage for sensitive configuration data like secrets, keys, and certificates.
- **Environment Variables:** Supported in all Azure services for injecting configurations dynamically.

Best Practices

- Keep sensitive data out of config files; use Key Vault or environment variables.
- Use separate config files or slots for dev, test, and prod environments.
- Use ARM/Bicep templates for infrastructure config versioning and automation.
- Validate configuration files locally before deployment.

üìå Notes

- Many Azure SDKs and services have native support to load configs from these files or services.
- Configurations can be overridden at runtime via portal, CLI, or API for flexibility.

### 7. Doing RDP in virtual machines.

üñ•Ô∏è How to Use RDP to Connect to Azure Virtual Machines

**What is RDP?**

- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** allows you to remotely connect to a Windows virtual machine (VM) and interact with its desktop environment.

  **Prerequisites**

- Azure VM must be **running Windows OS**.
- VM should have **RDP port (TCP 3389)** open in its Network Security Group (NSG).
- You need the VM's **public IP address** or DNS name.
- A valid **username and password** (or SSH key for Linux, but RDP is for Windows).

**Steps to Connect via RDP**

**1. Enable RDP Access**

- When creating the VM, ensure **RDP port 3389** is allowed in the **Inbound security rules** of the VM‚Äôs Network Security Group (NSG).
- If the VM is behind a firewall, make sure port 3389 is open.

**2. Obtain Connection Details**

- Go to the Azure Portal.
- Navigate to **Virtual Machines > Your VM**.
- Find the **Public IP address** or **DNS name**.

**3. Launch Remote Desktop Client**

- On Windows: Use built-in **Remote Desktop Connection** (`mstsc.exe`).
- On macOS/Linux: Use Microsoft Remote Desktop app or compatible RDP client.

**4. Connect to the VM**

- Open the RDP client.
- Enter the **public IP address** or **DNS name**.
- Enter your **VM username and password**.
- Click **Connect**.

**5. Accept the Security Certificate (if prompted)**

- Confirm and proceed with the connection.

**Troubleshooting Tips**

- **Port blocked:** Verify NSG and firewall settings allow inbound traffic on port 3389.
- **Incorrect credentials:** Make sure username and password are correct.
- **VM not running:** Ensure the VM is started.
- **Public IP change:** If the VM uses a dynamic IP, the address might have changed.

**Security Best Practices**

- Use **Just-In-Time (JIT) VM Access** to limit RDP exposure.
- Restrict RDP access by **IP address ranges**.
- Use **Azure Bastion** for secure RDP access without exposing port 3389 publicly.
- Enable **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** properly.

**Summary**

| Step              | Description                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Enable port 3389  | Open in NSG for inbound RDP traffic |
| Get public IP/DNS | From Azure portal VM overview       |
| Use RDP client    | Windows MSTSC or compatible client  |
| Connect & login   | Provide credentials and accept cert |
| Secure access     | Use JIT, Bastion, NSGs for security |
